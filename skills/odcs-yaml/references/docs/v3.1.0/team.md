# Team

This section lists team members and the history of their relation with this data contract. 

> [!NOTE]
> In v2.x, this section was called `stakeholders`. Starting with v3.1.0, both the following structure are valid. However, the original v2.x / v3.x structure is deprecated and will be removed in ODCS v4. 

The structure describing `team` is shared between all Bitol standards, matching RFC 0016.
