This document tracks the history and evolution of the **Open Data Contract Standard**.

# v3.1.0 - 2025-12-08 - APPROVED

* **Splits** Main specification document into several smaller documents. 
* Most sections have gained an optional `id` to enable easier linking as per RFC 26.
* The **`team`** block is accepting both ODCS v3.0.x structure (now obsolete) or the updated RFC16 structure. The obsolete structure will be removed in ODCS v4.
* **Adds** Relationships (Foreign Keys):
  * Add `relationships` array field to both `SchemaObject` and `SchemaProperty` to define foreign key relationships.
  * Support for property-level relationships where `from` field is implicit.
  * Support for schema-level relationships with explicit `from` and `to` fields.
  * Support for composite foreign keys using arrays in `from` and `to` fields.
  * Support for nested property references using dot shorthand notation (e.g., `accounts.address_street`).
  * Support for  nested property references using fully qualified references (e.g `/schema/schema_id/properties/my_property`)
  * Add `customProperties` to relationships for metadata like cardinality, labels, and descriptions.
  * New `Relationship` definition in JSON schema with fields:
    * `type`: Type of relationship (defaults to `foreignKey`)
    * `from`: Source property reference (optional at property level)
    * `to`: Target property reference (required)
    * `customProperties`: Additional metadata
* **Breaking change** to the JSON Schema (as a reminder the standard is not the JSON Schema but the textual document):
  * Alter `exclusiveMaximum` and `exclusiveMinimum` for `integer/number` logical data type to be `number` instead of `boolean`. [Conforms with JSON Schema specification](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/numeric#range).
  * Alter `exclusiveMaximum` and `exclusiveMinimum` for `date` logical data type to be `string` instead of `boolean`.
  * No additional or unevaluated properties are allowed for the following sections of the schema:
    * `authoritativeDefinitions`
    * `customProperties`
    * `dataQuality`
    * `dataQualityCheck`
    * `price`
    * `role`
    * `schemaElement`
    * `server`
    * `slaProperties`
    * `support`
    * `team`
  * Alter `team` to be an object instead of an array.
    * Adds `name`, `description`, `members`, `tags`, `customProperties`, `authoritativeDefinitions` fields to `team`.
    * Adds `tags`, `customProperties`, `authoritativeDefinitions` fields to `team.members`.
* **Changes** to logicalType and logicalTypeOptions:
  * Add `timestamp` and `time` to `logicalType` options.
  * Add `timezone` and `defaultTimezone` to `logicalTypeOptions` options for `timestamp` and `time`.
* **Changes** to Quality
  * Add a maintained library of commonly used quality metrics `rowCount`, `nullValues`, `invalidValues`, `duplicateValues`, and  `missingValues`.
  * Add `schedule` and `scheduler` to data quality properties.
* **Changes** to SLA:
  * Add optional `description` field to SLA entries for human-readable context.
* **Changes** to Support Channels:
  * Change `url` field to be optional.
  * Add `customProperties` field for additional metadata.
  * Add `notifications` as an example for `scope`
  * Add `googlechat` as an example for `tool`
* **Changes** to Servers:
  * AzureServer `format` not longer an enum of `parquet`, `delta`, `json`, `csv`, but rather a string with the same examples.
  * AzureServer `delimiter` not longer an enum of `new_line`, `array`, but rather a string with the same examples.
  * S3Server `format` not longer an enum of `parquet`, `delta`, `json`, `csv`, but rather a string with the same examples.
  * S3Server `delimiter` not longer an enum of `new_line`, `array`, but rather a string with the same examples.
  * SftpServer `format` not longer an enum of `parquet`, `delta`, `json`, `csv`, but rather a string with the same examples.
  * SftpServer `delimiter` not longer an enum of `new_line`, `array`, but rather a string with the same examples.
  * Added HiveServer with type `hive`.
  * Added ImpalaServer with type `impala`
  * Duckdb schema was expecting an integer, but should expect a string.
  * Added support for Actian Zen Server.
  * Added missing `stream` property to CustomServer.
* **Deprecations**:
  * `slaDefaultElement` is deprecated, and will be removed in ODCS v4.0.0 (see RFC 21).   
  * The `team` structure has evolved. Both are valid, however the ODCS v3.0.x structure is deprecated (see RFC 16).
* **Changes** to custom properties and authoritative definitions:
  * Add `description` field to both `customProperties` and `authoritativeDefinitions`.

* Reformat Markdown tables.


# v2.2.0 - 2023-07-27 - REPLACED BY v2.2.1

# v2.1.0 - 2023-03-23 - REPLACED BY v2.1.1

## Data Quality
The data contract adds elements specifically for interfacing with the Data Quality tooling. 

Additions:
* quality (table level & column level check):
* templateName (called standardVersion since v2.2.0)
* dimension
* type
* severity
* businessImpact
* scheduleCronExpression 
* customProperties
* columns
* isPrimaryKey

## Physical names
The data contract is a logical construct; we add more specific links to the physical world.

## Service-level agreement
The service-level agreements not previously used are more detailed to follow the DP QoS pattern. See SLA.

## Other
Removed the weight for system ratings from the data contract. Their default values remain.
